Archipelago Multiworld Randomizer mod for **Enter the Gungeon**. 



## Dependencies

Easiest to handle through a mod loader like R2ModMan or Thunderstore.
https://enter-the-gungeon.thunderstore.io/package/Alexandria/Alexandria/

 - EtG.Alexandria version **0.4.9**
 - ModTheGungeon version **1.9.1**
 - BepInEx version **5.4.21**

 ## Setup

 Enter the Gungeon is in a preview state for Archipelago and thus requires more involved setup. Please see https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en for details.

 Once an Archipelago server with EtG is setup, install the above mods. They are version dependent and will cause issues with mismatching APIs.

 Extract the contents of **ArchipelagoGungeon_vX.X.X** into the BepInEx plugin folder where the other mods are located:

 **ArchiGungeon.dll** should be within the first folder of ArchipelagoGungeon:

Once a run is started, the **Archipelagun** will spawn. Use the 'connect' command with server & slot data to connect.


Currently, location checks are handled by a simple progression of chests. Improvements are a work in progress!
