 ## Setup
 Enter the Gungeon is in a preview state for Archipelago and thus requires more involved setup. Please see https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en for details.

 Once an Archipelago server with EtG is setup, install the above mods. They are version dependent and will cause issues with mismatching APIs.

 Extract the contents of **ArchipelagoGungeon_vX.X.X** into the BepInEx plugin folder where the other mods are located:

 **ArchiGungeon.dll** should be within the first folder of ArchipelagoGungeon:

Once a run is started, the **Archipelagun** will spawn. Use the 'connect' command with server & slot data to connect.
Currently, location checks are handled by a simple progression of chests. Improvements are a work in progress!
